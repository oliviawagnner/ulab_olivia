1. The command ‘pwd’ will tell you your absolute path.
2. The command ‘ls ~/music/’ will show all files and directories. The files
that should be listed are ‘patterns.txt’ and ‘symmetry.py’. 
3. The command ‘nano ~/music/patterns.txt’ or ‘open ~/music/patterns.txt’.
4. The command ‘cat ~/music/patterns.txt’. 
5. The command ‘diff ~/music/patterns.txt ~/music/symmetry.txt’.
6. The command ‘mv ~/music/patterns.txt ~/math/calculus/’. 
7. The command ‘rm ~/math/geometry/triangle.txt’.
8. The command ‘cd ../math/’.
9. The command ‘git init’ will make math/ a local git repository. 
10. The command ‘git remote add origin <paste-URL>’. 
11. The command ‘cp ~/music/symmetry.txt ~/math/’.
12. The command ‘git status’. No, ‘symmetry.txt’ will not appear in the
staging area because we have not used ‘git add’ yet.
13. The command ‘git add symmetry.txt’ adds just ‘symmetry.txt’. The command
‘git add .’ adds all changes to all files and directories. 
14. Yes, git is not tracking ‘symmetry.txt’. The command ‘git reset HEAD
symmetry.txt’ will unstage ‘symmetry.txt’.
15. The command ‘git commit -m “Add symmetry.txt to math repository”’ will
commit the staged file ‘symmetry.txt’ to the local repository ‘math/’.
16. The command ‘git push origin main’ pushes to the remote repository. The
branch you should push to is the one you want your changes to apply to. For
many, the default branch is ‘main’, which was used in the code above. 
17. When inside the local math/ repository, the command ‘git checkout
applied_math’ creates a new branch.
18. The command ‘git checkout applied_math’.
19. The commands ‘git add physics/’, ‘git commit -m ‘“add physics directory
and mechanics.txt”’, and ‘git push origin applied_math’would push these
changes to the local repository. If you switch branches before committing
these changes, you might lose it, since you confuse git.
20. The command ‘git branch’ lists all your branches. The one you are currently
on will be highlighted in green.
21. The command ‘git checkout main’. 
22. After using ‘git checkout main’, the command ‘git merge applied_math’
will combine the two branches.
