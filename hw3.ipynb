    "\n",
    "    MAKE SURE TO TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF PUSHING THIS ASSIGNMENT FROM YOUR LOCAL TO REMOTE REPOSITORY \n",

    "        1) **Markdown Cells** - These cells contain plain text (like the cell you are reading right now)\n",
    "        2) **Code Cells** - These cells contain code that can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this assignment (and class) you don't need to worry about Markdown cells, just focus on the code cells for now.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## 2) How does a Jupyter Notebook work?\n",
    "    Click on a code cell, it will outline itself in blue. Now you are in **Edit Mode** and can make change to the code.\n",

    "\n",
    "    All the text and numbers inside a code cell will be read by a computer, unless you add a `#` in front, making it a **comment**. \n",
